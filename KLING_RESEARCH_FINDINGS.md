# KlingAI API Research Findings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCOVERY

After researching the KlingAI API documentation, I've discovered a **major limitation** that prevents us from achieving the migration goal.

---

## What We Found

### KlingAI API Limitations

**Maximum Video Duration: 10 seconds** ‚ùå

- Supported durations: **5 seconds** or **10 seconds** only
- This is **WORSE than Sora** which supports up to 12 seconds
- Far short of our goal: 30-60 second videos

### API Details Discovered

**Authentication:**
- Uses Access Key and Secret Key (you provided these)
- Bearer token authentication method

**Endpoints (via PiAPI/Official):**
- Base URL: `https://api-app-global.klingai.com` or third-party proxies
- POST request to create video generation task
- GET request to poll status
- Returns video URL when completed

**Models Available:**
- v1.0, v1.5, v1.6, v2.0, v2.1, v2.1-master, v2.5
- Text-to-video and Image-to-video modes
- Standard and Pro quality levels

**Generation Times:**
- 5-second video: ~5-6 minutes
- 10-second video: ~11-14 minutes

**Supported Formats:**
- Aspect ratios: 16:9, 9:16, 1:1
- Resolution: Up to 1080p
- Output: MP4

## Why This Is a Problem

| Original Goal | KlingAI Reality | Impact |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| 30-60s videos | Max 10s | ‚ùå Can't achieve goal |
| Better than Sora (12s) | Worse (10s) | ‚ùå Downgrade |
| Full demo narratives | Incomplete stories | ‚ùå Poor UX |
| Match presets (30-45s) | Only 25-33% of target | ‚ùå Not viable |

**Conclusion: KlingAI migration does NOT solve our duration problem.**

---

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Stay with Sora (Status Quo)
**Pros:**
- Already working (12 seconds)
- Better than KlingAI (10s)
- No migration effort
- Known quality

**Cons:**
- Still limited to 12 seconds
- Doesn't solve original problem

**Recommendation:** ‚≠ê Keep as baseline

---

### Option 2: Explore Other AI Video Providers

Let me research alternatives that actually support 30-60+ second videos:

#### 2A. Runway Gen-3
**Potential:**
- May support longer durations
- Professional quality
- Used by filmmakers

**Need to verify:**
- API availability
- Max duration
- Pricing

#### 2B. Pika Labs
**Potential:**
- Growing platform
- Creative controls
- Community adoption

**Need to verify:**
- API access
- Duration limits
- Quality vs. Sora

#### 2C. Luma Dream Machine
**Potential:**
- Fast generation
- Good quality
- API recently launched

**Need to verify:**
- Max video length
- API documentation
- Cost structure

#### 2D. Leonardo.ai (Hybrid Approach)
**Potential:**
- Image generation + motion
- Multi-stage workflow
- Might allow longer sequences

**Need to verify:**
- Video capabilities
- API for automation
- Duration support

### Option 3: Multi-Clip Stitching Strategy

**Concept:** Generate multiple short clips and stitch them together

**Approach:**
```
Generate 3x 12-second Sora clips
  ‚Üì
Stitch using FFmpeg
  ‚Üì
Result: 36-second video
```

**Pros:**
- Uses existing Sora integration
- Can achieve 30-60s duration
- Maintains Sora quality
- Control over scene transitions

**Cons:**
- More complex prompt engineering (scene 1, scene 2, scene 3)
- 3x generation cost
- 3x generation time
- Need seamless transitions
- Requires video processing backend

**Technical Implementation:**
1. Break 30s demo into 3x 10s segments
2. Generate prompts for each segment with continuity
3. Generate 3 videos in parallel (or sequentially)
4. Download all 3 videos
5. Stitch with FFmpeg (fade transitions)
6. Upload final composite video

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 days to implement

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Multi-Provider Strategy

**Concept:** Use different providers for different needs

**Examples:**
- **Short demos (<12s)**: Sora (highest quality)
- **Medium demos (12-30s)**: Stitched Sora clips
- **Long demos (30-60s)**: Alternative provider (if found)
- **Product screenshots**: Image generation ‚Üí animate with video AI

**Pros:**
- Best tool for each use case
- Flexibility
- Fallback options

**Cons:**
- Complex codebase
- Multiple API integrations
- Higher maintenance

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

**1. Clarify Your Priorities**

Which is more important?
- [ ] **Video quality** (Sora is excellent, but short)
- [ ] **Video length** (Need 30-60s, even if lower quality)
- [ ] **Cost efficiency** (Budget constraints?)
- [ ] **Time to market** (How urgently needed?)

**2. Research Alternative Providers**

I can investigate:
- [ ] Runway Gen-3 API documentation
- [ ] Pika Labs API availability
- [ ] Luma Dream Machine API specs
- [ ] Any other providers you suggest

**3. Consider Multi-Clip Stitching**

This might be the most pragmatic solution:
- ‚úÖ Uses existing Sora (proven quality)
- ‚úÖ Achieves 30-60s duration
- ‚úÖ Moderate effort (2-3 days)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful prompt engineering

---

## My Recommendation üéØ

**Phase 1: Quick Win (Multi-Clip Stitching)**
- Implement 3-clip stitching with Sora
- Achieves 36-second videos (3x 12s)
- Uses existing integration
- Timeline: 2-3 days

**Phase 2: Research & Evaluate**
- Meanwhile, research Runway Gen-3, Pika, Luma
- Test quality and duration limits
- Compare costs
- Decide on long-term provider

**Phase 3: Optimize**
- Implement best long-term solution
- Keep Sora as fallback
- Offer users choice of provider

## Cost Analysis Comparison

### Current (Sora)
- 12s video = 1 generation = $X (need Sora pricing)

### KlingAI (Not Viable)
- 10s video = 1 generation = $Y
- ‚ùå Doesn't meet requirements

### Multi-Clip Stitching (Sora)
- 36s video = 3 generations = 3x $X
- ‚úÖ Achieves duration goal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3x cost

### Alternative Provider (TBD)
- 30-60s video = 1 generation = $Z
- ‚úÖ If $Z < 3x $X, this wins

## Questions for You

Before we proceed, please advise:

1. **Do you want to proceed with KlingAI anyway?**
   - Even though it's 10s max (worse than Sora)?
   - Maybe for specific use cases?

2. **Should we implement multi-clip stitching?**
   - This would achieve 30-60s videos
   - Uses proven Sora quality
   - 2-3 days effort

3. **Should I research alternative providers?**
   - Runway Gen-3
   - Pika Labs
   - Luma Dream Machine
   - Others you know of?

4. **What's your priority order?**
   - Quality vs. Length vs. Cost vs. Time?

5. **Budget constraints?**
   - Is 3x cost for 3x length acceptable?
   - Or need to find cheaper alternatives?

## Technical Feasibility: Multi-Clip Stitching

If you want to go this route, here's how it would work:

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
```
Original 30s demo idea:
"Product demo showing problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí benefits"

Split into 3x 10s clips:

Clip 1 (0-10s): "Opening scene showing the problem.
Professional frustrated with current workflow. Close on their
concerned expression. Brand colors: #3b82f6."

Clip 2 (10-20s): "Continuation: Same professional now using
our product interface. Smooth interaction. Relief visible.
Seamless transition from previous scene. Brand colors: #3b82f6."

Clip 3 (20-30s): "Conclusion: Professional satisfied, seeing
results on screen. Team collaboration. Success metrics.
Final brand moment. Brand colors: #3b82f6."
```

### Stitching Implementation
```typescript
// app/api/process-video/route.ts - Enhanced version

// Generate 3 clips
const clips = await Promise.all([
  generateClip(prompt1, 1),
  generateClip(prompt2, 2),
  generateClip(prompt3, 3)
]);

// Stitch with FFmpeg
const stitchedVideo = await stitchClips(clips, {
  transition: 'fade',
  duration: 0.5 // 0.5s fade between clips
});

// Upload final video
const videoUrl = await uploadVideoToStorage(stitchedVideo, projectId);
```

### FFmpeg Command
```bash
ffmpeg -i clip1.mp4 -i clip2.mp4 -i clip3.mp4 \
  -filter_complex \
  "[0:v]fade=out:st=11.5:d=0.5[v0]; \
   [1:v]fade=in:st=0:d=0.5,fade=out:st=11.5:d=0.5[v1]; \
   [2:v]fade=in:st=0:d=0.5[v2]; \
   [v0][v1][v2]concat=n=3:v=1[outv]" \
  -map "[outv]" output.mp4
```

**Estimated Generation Time:**
- 3 clips √ó 5 minutes each = 15 minutes total
- Plus stitching: ~30 seconds
- **Total: ~15-16 minutes per video**

---

## Decision Time

Please let me know which direction you'd like to take:

- ‚ùå **KlingAI migration** (not recommended - 10s max)
- ‚≠ê **Multi-clip stitching with Sora** (recommended - pragmatic)
- üîç **Research alternative providers** (exploratory)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Stay with current Sora setup** (wait and see)

I'm ready to implement whichever path you choose!
