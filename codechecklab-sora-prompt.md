## Compiled Sora Prompt (30 seconds)

\`\`\`
Create a 30-second professional demo video for CodeCheck.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Industry: Construction Technology / Building Compliance Software
- Primary offering: Automated building code compliance verification for engineering drawings and specifications
- Target audience: Licensed engineers, architects, building departments, and permit reviewers

KEY FEATURES TO SHOWCASE:
- Upload PDF, DWG, DXF drawings and get instant compliance reports
- Verify against CSA, NBC, BCBC, ASHRAE, and major US/Canadian building codes
- JSON-based rulesets that automate compliance logic without programming

VISUAL STYLE:
- Aesthetic: Clean interfaces, technical drawings, professional office environments, engineering workstations
- Color palette: Professional blues, technical grays, clean whites. Engineering blueprint aesthetic.
- Pacing: Steady, confident, measured
- Tone: Professional, authoritative, data-driven. Technical credibility is critical.

SCENE STRUCTURE:
Scene 1 (0-6s): Problem statement - engineer buried in physical code books and marked-up drawings, multiple browser tabs open with building codes, frustrated with manual cross-referencing
Scene 2 (6-12s): Product interface - smooth upload of architectural drawings (show PDF/CAD file upload), clean dashboard showing project list and analysis status
Scene 3 (12-18s): Code analysis visualization - split screen showing drawing with automated code violation highlights, compliance report generating in real-time with specific code section references (CSA B31.3, NBC sections)
Scene 4 (18-24s): Professional report output - polished PDF compliance report on tablet, engineer presenting findings to team with confidence, document being submitted digitally
Scene 5 (24-30s): Success state - permit approval notification, timeline comparison showing "3 weeks → 8 hours", satisfied engineering team collaborating efficiently

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
This is compliance software for licensed professionals working on high-stakes building projects. The tone must be serious and technically credible - avoid any "playful" or "innovative startup" aesthetic. Show real engineering drawings (mechanical layouts, structural plans, site specs), not generic illustrations. The UI should look like professional engineering software, not consumer SaaS. Emphasize accuracy, regulatory compliance, and time savings. The target user is a P.Eng or licensed architect who needs defensible documentation for building permits.

Technical requirements:
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Resolution: 1080p
- No text overlays (we'll add code section callouts in post)
- Smooth transitions between scenes
- Professional polish with engineering/technical aesthetic

## Alternative Scene Structure (Product Demo - 45 seconds)

If you want a longer, more detailed walkthrough:

\`\`\`
Scene 1 (0-8s): Problem context - engineer with physical code book, measuring tools on printed drawings, sticky notes everywhere, looking overwhelmed
Scene 2 (8-20s): Feature 1: Upload - drag-and-drop interface showing PDF upload, automatic file parsing, system detecting drawing type (mechanical/structural/electrical)
Scene 3 (20-32s): Feature 2: Analysis - automated code checking engine running, violations being flagged on drawing with specific code references, confidence scores shown
Scene 4 (32-40s): Feature 3: Report generation - standardized compliance report with cross-referenced code sections, export to PDF, ready for permit office submission
Scene 5 (40-45s): Outcome - engineer submitting report digitally, "Review Complete" status, comparison showing 70% time reduction
\`\`\`

## Custom Instructions to Add

**If you want to emphasize specific aspects:**

"Focus heavily on the SOC 2 security certification in Scene 4 - show the SOC 2 badge clearly on the report. Our customers care deeply about data security because they're uploading proprietary engineering drawings."

OR

"Show the JSON ruleset feature prominently - demonstrate that users can customize compliance rules without needing a development team. This is a major differentiator."

OR

"Emphasize Canadian building codes (NBC, BCBC) over US codes. Most competitors focus on US markets - we're Canadian-first."

---

## Why This Prompt Works for CodeCheckLab

1. **Technical Credibility:** Uses engineering terminology (P.Eng, CSA B31.3, mechanical layouts)
2. **Visual Specificity:** Describes actual UI elements (dashboard, split-screen analysis, PDF reports)
3. **Audience Understanding:** Treats viewers as licensed professionals, not casual users
4. **Problem-Solution Flow:** Clear before/after showing manual vs automated workflow
5. **Regulatory Context:** Emphasizes permit submission and code compliance verification
6. **Time Savings Metric:** Concrete ROI (3 weeks → 8 hours)

## Next Step

Send this exact prompt to Sora API and evaluate:
1. Does it understand "building code compliance"?
2. Are the technical drawings realistic?
3. Does the tone feel professional enough for licensed engineers?
4. Is the problem-solution narrative clear?

Then refine scene timing or visual specifics based on output.
