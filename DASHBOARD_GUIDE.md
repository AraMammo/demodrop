## Real-Time Updates

### Dashboard Polling

When videos are in `scraping` or `generating` status:
- Fetches updates every 3 seconds
- Updates progress percentage
- Updates status badges
- Stops polling when completed/failed

**Implementation:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (video && (video.status === 'scraping' || video.status === 'generating')) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      fetchVideo();
    }, 3000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [video?.status]);
```

---

## Security

### Authentication

All dashboard and video routes are protected by Clerk middleware:
- Redirects to sign-in if not authenticated
- Only shows user's own videos
- Verifies ownership on all actions

### Ownership Verification

API routes check ownership:
```typescript
if (project.user_id !== userId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

### Blob Deletion

When deleting videos:
1. Verify user owns the video
2. Delete from blob storage
3. Delete from database
4. Handle errors gracefully

---

## Styling

### Design System

- **Colors:** Tailwind CSS with theme variables
- **Typography:** Inter font
- **Components:** shadcn/ui components
- **Layout:** Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)

### Status Colors

```css
scraping: bg-blue-100 text-blue-800
generating: bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800
completed: bg-green-100 text-green-800
failed: bg-red-100 text-red-800
```

### Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile:** 1 column
- **Tablet:** 2 columns (md:)
- **Desktop:** 3 columns (lg:)

## Performance

### Optimizations

- Video thumbnails use `preload="metadata"`
- Polling stops when video completes
- Blob deletion happens async
- Images lazy load
- Component code splitting

### Bundle Size

Remotion adds ~2MB to bundle:
- `@remotion/player`: ~1.5MB
- `@remotion/cli`: Development only
- `remotion`: ~500KB

---

## Troubleshooting

### Videos Not Loading

**Issue:** Videos don't appear in dashboard

**Check:**
1. User is signed in
2. Database query filtering by `user_id`
3. Videos exist for that user
4. Check browser console for errors

### Player Not Working

**Issue:** Remotion Player shows black screen

**Check:**
1. Video URL is valid and accessible
2. Video is MP4 format
3. CORS headers allow video access
4. Browser supports video codec

### Delete Not Working

**Issue:** Delete button doesn't work

**Check:**
1. User owns the video
2. Blob deletion permissions
3. Database delete permissions
4. Check API logs for errors

### Real-Time Updates Not Working

**Issue:** Status doesn't update during generation

**Check:**
1. Polling is active (check useEffect)
2. API returns updated status
3. No rate limiting on API
4. Component re-renders on state change
